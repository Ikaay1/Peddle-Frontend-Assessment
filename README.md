```

Navigate to the /github route as well.

## Dependencies Used

The following dependencies were required and used for the assessment:

- Millify - Converted long numbers to readable strings obtained from calling the REST api in the /github route
- Moment - Extracted and Parsed the date of each repository gotten from the GitHub API in the /github route.
- React-Icons - Got specific icons from a collection of libraries.
- React-Infinite-Scroll-Component - Used to implement infinite scroll in the /github route.
- React-Reveal - Implemented certain animations in the coming soon and contact components.
- Styled-Components - Used to style elements in .js files in organized manners.
- React-router-dom - Implemented routing to various pages

## What can be improved about this application

- The coming soon component could use a real time animated counter.
- For UI best practices a light and darkmode design of each page should be created with a custom button or switch to change styles to the desired mode. or render styles based on the specification by the OS.
